    <p>We believe that Southeast Asia, and in particular, Indonesia (with the world’s fourth largest population, attractive demographics, abundant natural resources, and a stable democracy) will continue to provide excellent investment opportunities going forward. The Sahabat Group has a broad and flexible investment mandate, and we have deployed the majority of our capital in sectors where we believe we can leverage our deep experience and long-standing relationships.
        We seek opportunities to invest in majority stakes or significant minority stakes in leading Southeast Asian companies. We are value-added investors who are prepared to work closely with management teams and play an active role in assisting our portfolio companies to reach their full potential. Although we will generally pursue investments in the consumer/retail, financial services, natural resources, and telecommunications sectors, we will opportunistically pursue investments in other sectors as well. 
        We are also prepared to back proven management teams to buy out businesses or to significantly expand their companies via a “buy and build” strategy. While we always drive our portfolio companies to “play the game better”, we often aim to “change the game” via helping our portfolio companies with acquisitions, new product development, expanded business strategies, and accessing new sources of capital. </p>
